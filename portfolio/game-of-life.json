{"html":"<p>I implemented a variant of the \nfamous <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life\">Game of Life</a> on \na hexagonal grid.\nPretty much all parameters of the game can be configured: rules for birth and survival,\nstart configuration, duration, and color palette.  </p>\n<p>While researching for this project, I stumbled upon a very \ninformative <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://davidsiaw.github.io/blog/2014/11/21/hexlife\">article</a> that\nrecommends the rule set <span class=\"emph\">B2/S34</span>, which means that cells are born if surrounded \nby exactly 2 living cells and they survive if surrounded by 3 or 4 other live cells. This configuration \nproduces some nice oscillators, e.g. this one:</p>\n<figure class=\"center\">\n<figcaption>B2/S34 <strong>Oscillator</strong></figcaption>\n<img src=\"portfolio/game-of-life.gif\" alt=\"B2/S34 - Oscillator\"/>\n</figure>\n\n\n<p>I experimented with the rules configuration a bit and found another interesting \nset of rules: <span class=\"emph\">B1/S12</span>.\nThis configuration allows for very fast growth and often results in mesmerizing evolutions like the one below:</p>\n<figure>\n<figcaption>B1/S12 <strong>Expansion</strong></figcaption>\n<img src=\"portfolio/game-of-life/expansion.gif\" alt=\"B1/S12 - Expansion\"/>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Feel free to play around as well!</p>\n<p><span class=\"meta\">Source Code:</span>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/LenaSchnedlitz/hexagonal-game-of-life\" class=\"link\">GitHub\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"icon icon-inline\"><use xlink:href=\"icons/sprite.svg#link\"/></svg></a></p>\n","slug":"game-of-life","rank":2,"title":"Game of Life","teaser":"Conway's famous game implemented on a hexagonal grid.","previewType":"gif","background":"gray-dark","align":"right"}
